## 1. What is a URL shortening system?

A URL shortening system is a service that takes a long URL and generates a shorter, more manageable version. When users click on the shortened URL, they are redirected to the original long URL. This is typically achieved by mapping the shortened URL to the long URL in a database, and the system performs the redirection when the short URL is accessed.

## 2. What's the main value? Who needs such a system and why?

### Main Value:
Shortened URLs are easier to share, remember, and type. They are especially useful for platforms with character limits, such as Twitter. URL shortening services often provide analytics, allowing users to track clicks, geographic data, and other metrics. Custom short URLs can enhance brand recognition and trust.

### Who Needs It and Why:
- **Social Media Users:** To share links without exceeding character limits.
- **Marketers and Advertisers:** For better tracking and analytics of link performance.
- **Businesses:** For creating branded links that enhance credibility and recognition.
- **Individuals:** For sharing long URLs in a more convenient and aesthetically pleasing way.

## 3. Describe the main mechanism of work and system components.

### Main Mechanism of Work:
1. **URL Submission:** User submits a long URL to the system.
2. **URL Storage:** The system generates a unique short code and stores the mapping of this short code to the long URL in a database.
3. **Short URL Generation:** The system returns the short URL to the user, typically in the form of `http://short.url/abcd`.
4. **Redirection:** When the short URL is accessed, the system looks up the short code in the database, retrieves the long URL, and redirects the user to the original long URL.

## 4. What do you think are the main challenges in implementing and running the system?

### Main Challenges:
- **Scalability:** Handling a large volume of requests and URL mappings efficiently.
- **Avoiding collision:** Efficiently avoiding two links not mapping to exact same short likn.
- **Reliability:** Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance of the system.
- **Link Expiry and Management:** Handling expired or inactive links gracefully.

## 5. Try to suggest some ideas for advanced features.

### Advanced Features:
- **Custom Short URLs:** Allow users to create custom aliases for their links.
- **Custom Expiration:** Provide options for links to expire after a certain date or number of clicks.
- **Password Protection:** Enable password protection for sensitive links.
- **Geo targeting:** Redirect users to different URLs based on their geographic location.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Offer detailed analytics, including user demographics, referrer data, and time-based usage patterns.
